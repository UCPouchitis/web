[My group and I](http://merenlab.org) are working on microbial metagenomes to identify determinants of community succession after the functionalization of the pouch with the aim of identifying associations between hypervariable genomic islands of key microbial members of these habitats and progress of the disease. Our investigations involve multiple 'omics strategies, including genome-resolved metagenomics, pangenomics, and microbial population genetics.
