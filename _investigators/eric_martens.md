Dr. Eric Martens is an Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan. The human gastrointestinal tract is home to trillions of symbiotic microorganisms that influence human physiology in many ways. [Martens Lab](https://www.ericmartenslab.org/) investigates these processes at multiple levels with the goal of using diet and gut microbial interventions to improve health and treat chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.
