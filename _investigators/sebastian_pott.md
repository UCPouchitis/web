Dr. Pott is a Research Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Section of Genetic Medicine at the University of Chicago. The gut is a highly complex organ with many different cell types within the mucosa, many of which are affected by, and contribute to, the development of pouchitis and IBD in general. [We](https://genes.uchicago.edu/admin/person/sebastian-pott) are using single cell genomics techniques to detect and understand cell-type specific gene expression that is associated with the development of pouchitis.
