The [Huang lab](https://pme.uchicago.edu/group/huang-lab) utilizes a combined expertise in immunology and single-cell omics technologies to understand the role of immune cells in IBD. Through these technologies, we hope to provide a comprehensive genetic/proteomic profile and spatial context to uncover aberrant immune cell function as it relates to disease pathogenesis.
