Dr. Tay is an Associate Professor at Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. [The Tay Lab](https://taylab.uchicago.edu/) wants to understand, model and manipulate complex biological systems to help cure diseases. To enable this, we develop high-throughput automated microfluidic and optofluidic systems that perform quantitative, multi-dimensional and dynamic measurements with single-cell resolution.
