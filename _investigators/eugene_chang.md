[Eugene B. Chang (MD)](https://changlab.uchicago.edu/) is the project director and lead investigator of the high impact, interdisciplinary NIDDK RC2 (DK122394) program, focused on defining the microbial and genetic basis of complex immune disorders like inflammatory bowel diseases. As an internist and gastroenterologist trained at the University of Chicago, Dr. Chang is interested in defining the underpinnings of health, understanding the causes of disease, and finding solutions to improve patient management and clinical outcomes. As a scientist, he defines himself as an experimentalist whose expertise complements those of a very talented, multi-disciplinary RC2 team that includes experts in microbiology, genetics, immunology, computational sciences, cellular and molecular biology, engineering, and clinical research. Through this RC2 program, Dr. Chang hopes to find the causes of human inflammatory bowel diseases which will lead to prevention, more targeted interventions, and eventual cure.
