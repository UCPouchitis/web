<p class="et_pb_member_position">PI (UChicago GI)</p>
<div><p>Eugene B. Chang, MD is the lead and senior investigator of the high impact, interdisciplinary NIDDK RC2 (DK122394) program focused on defining the microbial and genetic basis of complex immune disorders like inflammatory bowel diseases. As an internist and gastroenterologist trained at the University of Chicago, Dr. Chang is interested in defining the underpinnings of health, understanding the causes of disease, and finding solutions to improve patient management and clinical outcomes. As a scientist, he defines himself as an experimentalist whose expertise complements those of a very talented, multi-disciplinary RC2 team that includes experts in microbiology, genetics, immunology, computational sciences, cellular and molecular biology, engineering, and clinical research. Through this RC2 program, Dr. Chang hopes to find the causes of human inflammatory bowel diseases which will lead to prevention, more targeted interventions, and eventual cure.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>Our group is focused on quantifying variability in the physiological properties of B. fragilis strains isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed patients. We are working to understand the genetic basis of these physiologic differences, and testing their contribution to disease in in vitro and in vivo models.&nbsp;</p>
