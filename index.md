Welcome to UCPouchitis web resource.

The purpose of this NIDDK High Impact, Interdisciplinary Team Science, Multi-'Omic project (RC2DK122394) is to study the cause of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

We aim to understand host and microbial basis for human ulcerative colitis and pouchitis through the identification of role and mechanisms behind the host susceptibility and pathobiont factors.

Our group is composed of [multiple investigators](Investigators.html) that work in [four main teams](Teams.html).

## Summary

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) result from the convergence of host, environmental, and microbial factors— each necessary, but not sufficient to cause disease. Although these factors are known, how these mechanisms interact to contribute to disease susceptibility and microbial triggers are still unclear. Our research team, consisting of multi-institutional, interdisciplinary experts, are utilizing a novel clinical model to address this issue.

## Advantage of the Study Design

Nearly half of patients with medically-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) who have undergone total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) develop pouchitis, an inflammatory condition of their ileal pouch within two years (ref). Patients recruited into the study are monitored starting from prior to pouch functionalization to two years after. This longitudinal study offers distinct advantages over other clinical studies. First, we sample and evaluate patients before, during, and after the development of pouchitis. Biopsies, mucosal brushings, luminal aspirate samples are collected to assess both host and microbial states. To date, we cannot predict if and when pouchitis will occur. Sampling during multiple visits provide real-time snapshots of disease activity; therefore, individual patients provide samples that serve as their own experimental controls. This is a critical point because each individual has a unique genetic makeup, diet, and environment that all affect disease susceptibility.

## Preliminary Results

Previous discoveries from Dr. Chang’s lab has shown that, pouch tissue displayed anomalous transcriptomic gene expression compared to pre-pouch, regardless of pouchitis development (ref). Also, the team is studying whether genetic changes in Bacteroides fragilis, an otherwise gut commensal microbe, may be responsible for triggering pouchitis in susceptible individuals.

## Significance

The study is based on a team approach to disentangle host, microbial, and the integrative processes that manifest into pouchitis leading to insights into the causes of some forms of IBD. This study links basic, translational, and clinical scientific research by focusing on molecular and genetic mechanisms of host and microbial cells with the objective of building a base for future interventions—preventative, therapeutic or development of a cure— for many types of complex immune diseases; ultimately, altering the outcome for these patients.
