<p>In previous findings, we reported that all Ulcerative Colitis (UC) pouchitis subjects exhibit an anomalous gene transcriptome of their ileal pouch. These findings were made in colonoscopic pinch biopsy and were not observed in the pre-pouch. i.e. the segment of bowel immediately above the pouch which is the same ileal tissue as the pouch. The pre-pouch transcriptome in fact is very similar to normal non-IBD transcriptomes that were previously published and rarely develops disease (unless there is back flux of pouch content). In contrast, the transcriptomes of the pre-pouch and pouch from non-Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) patients (those with familial adenomatous polyposis) are not different. These patients rarely develop pouchitis and, if they do, it is different from UC pouchitis. Nearly half of UC pouch patients will develop pouchitis within 2 years, which responds to antibiotic therapy, but often relapses after the cessation of the Abx, implicating a role for the pouch microbiome and possibly the emergence of a pathobiont. A nearly identical transcriptome was independently reported in a subgroup of Crohnâ€™s disease patients a year after our report, suggesting this is a genetic aberration of IBD subjects that defines a group of subjects that share a common etiopathogenesis. The RC2 is based on the notion that disentangling the host, microbial, and the integrative processes that occur over time prior to the development of pouchitis will lead to insights into the cause of some forms of IBD.  This knowledge can then be leveraged to identify subjects at risk for IBD for whom targeted and effective interventions that prevent, treat, or cure can be developed.</p>
