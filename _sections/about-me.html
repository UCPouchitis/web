<h1> Overview </h1> 

<p>
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) result from the convergence of host, environmental, and microbial factors— each necessary, but not sufficient to cause disease. Although these factors are known, how these mechanisms interact to contribute to disease susceptibility and microbial triggers are still unclear. Our research team, consisting of multi-institutional, interdisciplinary experts, are utilizing a novel, clinical model to address this issue. Nearly half of patients with medically-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) who have undergone total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) develop pouchitis, an inflammatory condition of their ileal pouch within two years (ref). Patients recruited into the study are monitored starting from prior to pouch functionalization to two years after.  This longitudinal study offers distinct advantages over other clinical studies. 
First, we sample and evaluate patients before, during, and after the development of pouchitis. Biopsies, mucosal brushings, luminal aspirate samples are collected to assess both host and microbial states. To date, we cannot predict if and when pouchitis will occur.  Sampling during multiple visits provide real-time snapshots of disease activity; therefore, individual patients provide samples that serve as their own experimental controls.  This is a critical point because each individual has a unique genetic makeup, diet, and environment that all affect disease susceptibility. Previous discoveries from Dr. Chang’s lab has shown that, pouch tissue displayed anomalous transcriptomic gene expression compared to pre-pouch, regardless of pouchitis development (ref). Also, the team is studying whether genetic changes in Bacteroides fragilis, an otherwise gut commensal microbe, may be responsible for triggering pouchitis in susceptible individuals. The RC2 is based on the notion that disentangling host, microbial, and the integrative processes that manifest into pouchitis will lead to insights into the causes of some forms of IBD.  This study links basic, translational, and clinical scientific research by focusing on molecular and genetic mechanisms of host and microbial cells with the objective of building a base for future interventions—preventative, therapeutic or development of a cure— for many types of complex immune diseases; ultimately, altering the outcome for these patients.
