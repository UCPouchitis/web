**Dr. Chang** (IBD, experimentalist) will serve as the Program PI and Director, responsible for overseeing every aspect of the program. **Dr. Sogin** (microbial ecologist) is the co-Director, assisting Dr. Chang in managing the strategic, operational, and data science aspects of the RC-2. 

**Drs. Tay, Eren, Crosson, Watterson, Antonopoulos, and Chang** are currently working on developing an advanced working high throughput cultivator â€“ an example of cross-disciplinary interaction between computational sciences (Eren), device engineering (Tay), microbiology and microbial genetics (Antonopoulos, Crosson), and experimental biology (Chang). The products of their efforts (unique microbial strains and consortia) will be functionally tested in in vitro and in vivo systems developed or modified by **Drs. Chang and Jabri** (Mucosal immunology).

**Drs. Eric Martens (University of Michigan) and Laurie Comstock (Harvard)**, experts in microbiology and microbial genetics, are vital members of the group. Through their generous sharing of tools and approaches that they developed to study Bacteroides species, **Drs. Crosson, Shan, and Fiebig** have been able to move rapidly in developing critical intermediate CPS mutants of Bacteroides fragilis strains that ultimately set the stage to achieve the goal of establishing mono-CPS expressing strains that will then be interrogated by Drs. Chang, Jabri, and Antonopoulos in cell, tissue, and animal model systems.
